            <description>Codebridge Youth Bees creating a buzz - It has been hectic for the first six months of 2022 for the Codebridge Youth project team. With a total of six workshops in five different municipalities and an attendance of approximately 150 young people, it is safe to say that we have “worked” our socks off!</description>

            <description>After being forced to migrate to a fully virtual method of interfacing with our audiences during lockdown, we slowly move back to face to face engagements with some learnings that cannot be unlearned from the days of 100% virtual.

But its health services remain a source of ongoing concern for residents, who regularly complain about long waiting periods and quality of care. </description>

            <description>OpenUp in partnership with Geekulcha, Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) and LP Dev Ecosystems hosted a data literacy workshop in Mokopane, Limpopo. The workshop took place on 22 April 2023 at Aletuke Community Care Center in Mokopane. The objectives of the workshop were to introduce the youth to basic data skills, and showcase how data can be used to tell an evidence based story with the intention to drive change in their communities. HSRC also showcased how data can be simplified and packaged using graphs to tell a story. The data literacy workshop is an activity under OpenUp’s Codebridge Youth project. To assess the impact of the data workshop, we created a pre and post workshop survey and asked the participants to complete it before and after the workshop. </description>

            <description>We recently hosted a Youth Summit in partnership with the Trevali Mining Corporation in the small Namibian town of Rosh Pinah. This is a first in the project, where the primary partner is Business. Based on the data we collected, we will better understand the youth, their challenges, and the opportunities they seek.</description>

            <description>The Codebridge Youth Project falls under OpenUp’s Citizen Engagement Programme. The programme exists to enable citizens, through the use of civic technology, to create platforms to engage with their government and other sectors to improve the quality of life in their communities. Codebridge Youth (CBY) focuses explicitly on the youth demographic. </description>
