Participants were taken through the municipal processes and how to access the relevant information to make informed decisions in their municipality. The aim of public participation is to increase civic engagement within local government. Before the OpenUp team shared knowledge on public participation, surveys were conducted by participants for the team to assess the level of awareness participants had on municipal processes including public participation.\_\n\n‍\n\n![](/assets/images/downloaded/64464a49657eba5694d5576d_IMG_6168.jpg)\n\n‍"
