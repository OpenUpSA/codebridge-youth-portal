OpenUp in partnership with Umgeni Local Municipality, GeeKulcha and HSRC is launching CodeBridge Youth!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### #Inform #Empower #Activate

OpenUp is excited to announce the launch of CodeBridge Youth in a KZN located municipality, funded by Luminate. CodeBridge Youth is a programme created by OpenUp in response to strengthen public participation between Citizens and Local Government.

‍

The event aims to gather 40 participants from Howick aged between 14-35. CodeBridge Youth is an educational programme about the IDP process and the effective use of Intergovernmental Structures to enable the Youth to #UNMUTE\_their\_VOICE through expressing their needs using civic technology and existing structures. This serves to enable Youth to be empowered to learn in safe spaces amongst peers, and to acquire key skills to practice data driven, digital citizenship.
