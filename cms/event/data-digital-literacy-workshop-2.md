f_event-report: "  \n‍\n\n‍  \nOpenUp hosted a Data and Digital literacy workshop in the town of Citrusdal, in the Cederberg Municipality. The Codebridge Youth Project is a fundamental part of the organisation’s goals of “inform - empower - activate” through this project we aim to enhance the relationship between government and its citizens.\_\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d2709341443e07ee7ccd710/64253a4f7c0b776334ef47c2_IMG_5150.jpg)\n\nAdrian Kearns, a project manager at OpenUp, presented some data tools available for understanding the community demographics of Cederberg. Youth were very engaging, interested to know more about their youth demographic, and how they could use the data to engage the decision makers on issues like unemployment, access to learning opportunities after grade 12, and also, why opportunities available to youth are often for the select few, and not inclusive for all young people.\n\n‍\n\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d2709341443e07ee7ccd710/64253cd8f2535d7bf0091fa2_IMG_5109.jpg)\n\nAn outcome of the workshop was to draft a letter to the Cederberg Municipality to raise some of these issues, as well as request a meeting to engage transparently and with a clear direction for both parties.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍"
