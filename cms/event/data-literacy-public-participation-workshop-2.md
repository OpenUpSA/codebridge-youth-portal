In September 2022, Cape Agulhas Municipality (CAM) in partnership with OpenUp organized a two-day workshop on data literacy and public participation. The workshop was held at the Anene Booysen Skills Development Centre in Bredasdorp. The aim of the workshop was to equip participants with the necessary skills and knowledge to enhance their understanding of data and how it can be used to facilitate public participation in decision-making processes. Prior to the workshop, participants were provided with an overview of the agenda and expectations. Through interactive sessions and practical exercises, the workshop aimed to empower participants to engage effectively with data and promote greater citizen participation in their communities.
