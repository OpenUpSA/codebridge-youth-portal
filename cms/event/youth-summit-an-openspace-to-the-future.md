The Youth Summit was an empowering platform created for young people to address the challenges they face in their community. Over the course of three days, 103 participants gathered at the Rosh Pinah Community Hall to explore key themes that are relevant to them.

The themes that were explored at the Youth Summit were: "I want to connect", "I want to be involved", "I want to create opportunities", "I want to drive change", and "I want to influence decision making." These themes provided a framework for young people to develop solutions that address the challenges they face and create positive change in their community.

Through workshops, interactive discussions, and collaboration, the youth were able to develop actionable solutions to the issues they identified. The summit was an opportunity for young people to showcase their creativity, leadership, and determination to make a difference.

We believe that the Youth Summit was a successful and inspiring event that showcased the power of youth to drive change in their communities. We hope that this event will continue to inspire young people to take action and create positive change in their communities. Stay tuned for more updates on youth initiatives and opportunities to get involved
