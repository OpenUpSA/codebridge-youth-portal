This Call for Comment leads us into the final lap of the current participation cycle. As a group, we have started from a point of not knowing what an Integrated Development Plan (IDP) is, to attending a public meeting, and completing your own project submissions to your municipality. 

To assist you in this process we’ve prepared a comment cheat sheet. The comment cheat sheet explains what each of the strategic documents is, how they are linked to one another, and why it’s important for you to participate. 

It also provides a walk-through with tips and techniques for digging into those documents, and the different approaches you can adopt to give comments or input on your municipality's plans for the year ahead.
